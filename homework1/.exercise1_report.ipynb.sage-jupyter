{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":"The Collatz conjecture states that no matter which n is an element of the natural numbers you begin with, the sequence of integers n_k will be finite and end with the number one. From the image above by testing the first 5000 natural numbers we can infer that the Collatz Conjecture is valid, as within the first 5000 natural numbers there are the majority of different cases of numbers tested. I.e. the first 5000 natural numbers contain odd, even, prime, square and cube numbers, which have all been tested to give a finite stopping time as they all eventuall end with a sequence of (...4, 2, 1). Therefore we can infer that the Conjecture is true. It does seem more likely if we plot the stopping times for larger n.\n\nWe can see from the graph above that there exists a pattern amongst the natural numbers and their stopping times grouping several consecutive natural numbers together with a similar stopping time, before a number is reached with a stopping time much higher than its surrounding natural numbers. Hence, by plotting the stopping time for larger n, we would see this pattern to continue and the stopping time would increase further.\n\nHowever, by simply testing the first 5000 natural numbers we cannot sufficiently conclude that the Collatz is true for all natural numbers, as there may exist an infinite Collatz sequence for a particular n_k which takes an infinite stopping time to reach one. I.e. this sequence contains a loop such that C(a0) = a1, C(a1) = a2,.....C(aq) = a0. In this example we enter an infinite loop within the Collatz map in which case we would never reach 1 and hence the stopping time would be infinite. In this case the Collatz conjecture would be false, however up to present there has not been such a number that has been found to produce an infinite sequence within the Collatz map.\n\nFrom analysing this graph, it predicts that for plotting the stopping time for larger n, this pattern of grouping consecutive number stopping times together before reaching a number with a much greater stopping time, would continue for larger n and hence a larger stopping time. However, it is not easy to predict from this graph whether a loop would occur for a certain natural number, and hence give rise to  the Conjecture being false."}
